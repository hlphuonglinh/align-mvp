# Align MVP v1 (Calendar-agnostic)

## Inputs
- Chronotype quiz answers (deterministic)
- Hard constraints (non-negotiables)
- Optional calendar structure as BusyBlocks (start/end/allDay/source) — NO titles/content

## Outputs
- Reliability windows (by mode)
- Governance decisions: PERMIT / WARN / SILENCE with structural reasons

## Must not
- Coaching, motivation, productivity language
- Inference from event names/descriptions/attendees/location
- Auto-rescheduling / auto-writing to calendar
- Accounts required
- Backend required (v1)

## Calendar tiers
- Tier 0: manual BusyBlocks (must fully work)
- Tier 1: optional ONE provider later (Google OR Microsoft), read-only, structure only
